## Career

Experienced Front-End Architect with a demonstrated history of working in the tech & healthcare industry. Skilled in User Experience, User Interface Design, Front-End Development, and Angular. When people ask me what I do, I usually just tell them, "I make the web look pretty."

## Life

Loving father, supportive boyfriend, traveler, risk-taker, sports enthusiast and coffee addict. Operating life around the sweet spot between order and chaos and currently living in the beautiful bluffs of La Crosse, WI. I sometimes make random things with friends.
